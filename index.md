# The Fall Of The Witchers

## Act I: The Rise of Tension

### Act I Scene I: The Return of Ilistus
*[Enter Ilistus, cloaked in shadows after a lengthy absence. His eyes burn with ambition.]*

**[Ilistus]**

Once more I step into the fray, my friends,

This kingdom, Witchers, long in slumber steeped,

Shall rise anew, its glory I shall mend,

Beneath my hand, a destiny unreeled!


*[Enter Minos, now the leader of Witchers]*


**[Minos]**

Ilistus, returned, we greet thee with open arms,

Though caution whispers, etched in troubled times.

The path ahead brims with both threat and charms,

A tangled web where peril often climbs.


**[Ilistus]**

Fear not, Minos, for I, with purpose bold,

Shall guide Witchers to a future bright!

Our assets, vast, a story yet untold,

Shall leave our foes with trembling and with fright!


*[Minos, his brow furrowed with suspicion, offers a curt nod, his eyes never leaving Ilistus.]*


**[Minos]** *side*

His words are fair, his promises ignite,

But shadows lurk within his burning gaze.

With cautious heart, I tread a path of night,

For Witchers' fate hangs in these coming days.


*[A tense silence hangs heavy in the air. Ilistus stands tall, a charismatic figure with a hidden agenda. Minos watches him intently, burdened by the weight of leadership and the uncertainty of Ilistus's return.]*

### Act I Scene II: Whispers in the Shadows

*[Enter Minos, with steadfast mien, and by his side, Axion, Capricio, Kestrelia do confide. Within a chamber veiled from prying eyes they stand, Their brows all furrowed, heavy with command.]*

**[Minos]**

Capricio, wise, and Kestrelia, keen of sight,

I call you forth to council in this hidden night.

A specter from the past, Ilistus, doth return,

His hungry heart for power fiercely doth yearn.

For Witchers' fate I tremble, lest it fall,

A victim to his pride that conquers all.

**[Capricio]**

Your words, Minos, do echo truth's decree,

Ilistus' presence shadows misery.

His history, a web of twisted lies,

Demands from us a cautious, watchful guise.

**[Kestrelia]**

In times of storm, when tempests rage and swell,

Our unity, our wisdom, are the spells

That shield us from the darkness. Minos, strong,

On you rests Witchers' safety, righting wrong.

Let discord's whispers find no purchase here,

May harmony and reason banish fear.

**[Axion]**

My counsel, friend, with loyalty I bring:

A measured hand, a cautious step we take, for king,

For Ilistus' touch still holds a potent sway

O'er hearts that may be tempted to betray.

Our defenses, let us bolster and make fast,

Lest Witchers crumble 'neath ambition's blast.

**[Minos]**

Your voices, friends, a chorus strong and true,

To face the storm Ilistus may brew.

Witchers shall stand, a fortress 'gainst his might,

And banish darkness back into the night.

*[The council huddles close, their voices low, A strategy they forge to meet the coming woe.]*

### Act I Scene III: Denouncement and Disquiet

*[Enter Ilistus, with a stern visage, approaching Minos]*

**[Ilistus]**

King Minos, hark! The Witchers' realm cannot endure

While traitors fester 'neath its righteous hood.

Morbius, once sworn in trust, now seeks to bend

This kingdom's will, a serpent misunderstood.

His presence taints the air, a festering blight,

And casts a shadow on our sunlit might.

*Minos, with a heavy heart, nods in agreement*

**[Minos]**

Alas, Ilistus, your words ring all too true.

Morbius' allegiance, sadly, seems to wane.

Begone, then, Morbius, from Witchers' view,

Nor trouble us with discord once again.

*Morbius exits, a mask of fury etched upon his face*

**[Ilistus]**

But pause, King Minos, for another foe

Lurks in the shadows, whispers soft and low.

Capricio, a viper in our midst he lies,

His serpent's tongue with poisoned venom flies.

The Witchers' greatest bane, his plots unfold,

A threat more dire than tales of old.

*[Minos, his brow furrowed, gazes upon Ilistus with growing unease. The seeds of doubt are sown. He ponders seeking counsel from the council.]*

### Act I Scene IV: The Council's Edict

*[The shadowed chamber whispers once again]*

**[Minos]** *Grim Visage*

Capricio, Kestrelia, dire pronouncements ring.

Ilistus' tongue hath branded thee our foe,

Though Morbius walks the path of exile now,

Thy counsel, Capricio, still doth brightly glow.

**[Capricio]** *With measured tone*

No malice stirs within my breast for them,

The Witchers stand apart from this decree.

Morbius, a friend, with steadfast purpose came,

His banishment, a wrong that must not be.

**[Kestrelia]** *Her voice rings true*

Wisdom's call compels us to hold fast,

To cast aside our allies brings us woe.

Hearken, Minos, to wisdom's guiding cast,

Restore Morbius, let council's strength outgrow.

**[Axion]** *Voice deep and strong*

Minos, of old, Morbius with steady hand,

Did carve the Witchers' triumphs, etched in stone.

His presence here, a pillar that shall stand,

Renewing strength upon this troubled throne.

**[Minos]** *With weighty pause*

So be it then. Morbius shall find release,

And join our council in this shadowed hall.

Together, face the tempests that increase,

And navigate the perils that enthrall.

### Act I Scene V: Ilistus's Demotion

**[Minos]**

Hark, Ilistus, attend! Thy duties, once so grand,

Must now be circumscribed. No longer shall thy hand

Direct the threads of foreign policy, for see,

Thy actions wrought discord 'mongst our allies, you and me.

**[Ilistus]**

What foulest play is this? A demotion, sire? Unfair!

My power thus diminished, is this a burden I must bear?

**[Minos]**

For Witchers' greater good, this course we must maintain.

On matters close to home, your talents may remain.

But diplomacy's a dance too intricate for thee,

Henceforth, such steps shall fall to those with greater artistry.

**[Ilistus]** *storms out*

By Styx, this slight shall not stand unavenged! This day,

Minos shall rue the hour they cast me from their way!

Their scorn shall find an answer, swift and sure, I vow,

For vengeance shall be mine, and fate shall make them bow!

### Act I Scene VI: The Aftermath

*[Enter Capricio, Kestrelia, Axion, and Minos]*

**[Capricio]**

Minos, a daring deed, of that there's no mistake,

But Ilistus' ire, a fearsome storm it'll wake.

**[Kestrelia]**

Prepare, O Minos, for the tempest's coming nigh,

Within thy realm, let strength and unity now lie.

Our allies, too, with steadfast hearts must stand their ground,

For Ilistus' vengeance on these lands will soon resound.

**[Axion]**

Let not our borders slumber, nor our watch be weak,

For Ilistus' fury may from any quarter streak.

With vigilance and steel, we'll face the coming strife,

Maintain your posts, and guard with purpose, every life.

**[Minos]**

Your counsel rings with truth, and I shall heed it well,

With wisdom's hand to guide, what storms may come, we'll quell.

*[The council nods in unison, their faces grim and set, A silent vow to meet the threat, and never yield to regret.]*

## Act II: The Rising Tempest

### Act II, Scene I: The Burden of Minos

*[Enter Minos, his brow furrowed with care]*

**[Minos]** *With weary sigh*

A crown, a weight, a burden on this head,

This kingdom's woes upon my shoulders rest.

The path we walk is fraught with dangers dread,

A precipice where Witchers find no rest.

*[Enter Capricio, Axion, and Kestrelia]*

**[Capricio]**

Great Minos, though through trials we have come,

And weathered storms that threatened to engulf,

A shadow falls, a whisper of the drum

Of Ilistus' plotting, ever sly and wolfish.

**[Kestrelia]**

Aye, Minos, unity, a fortress strong,

Whispers wisdom in this shadowed hour.

Let hearts be steeled, let purpose bind us long,

To shield this realm from every vengeful power.

**[Axion]**

The seeds of discord Ilistus did sow,

Still bear their bitter fruit, a poisoned name.

Our trust is fractured, allies wary now,

His machinations kindle burning shame.

**[Minos]**

Your words, my friends, like beacons in the night,

Guide us through darkness. We shall stand as one.

Lest Ilistus' ambition take its flight,

And plunge this land into oblivion.

### Act II Scene II: Council Deliberation

*[The secret council convenes, now including Morbius]*

**[Minos]**

Noble Capricio, wise Kestrelia,  

And steadfast Axion, we face a dire  

Challenge. Ilistus's influence grows,  

His schemes do threaten all that we hold dear.  

Morbius, thy presence here with us now  

Doth testify our unity and strength.

**[Morbius]**

I thank thee for restoring me to grace.  

As one who helped to build the Witchers’ base,  

I lend my wisdom to preserve our cause,  

To guard against the threats that now arise.

**[Capricio]**

Indeed, Morbius's return doth bring  

A strength renewed. Ilistus's ambition  

Must be checked, lest discord within our ranks  

Doth spread and fester, leading to our fall.

**[Kestrelia]**

Our greatest strength lies in our unity.  

We must fortify defenses, sure,  

And keep our allies true and steadfast, firm,  

To face the trials that lie ahead for us.

**[Axion]**

Morbius, thou art old guard, an ally  

In building our great assets. Thus, we now  

Together navigate these treacherous waters,  

With strength combined, to weather every storm.

**[Minos]**

So be it. Let us now prepare ourselves  

For what may come. Ilistus’s ambitions  

Must be curbed, for the good of Witchers all.

### Act II Scene III: Ilistus's Grand Standing

*[Ilistus, in the tournament planning room, removes certain members and invites others without notice]*

*[Minos chooses not to partake in the drama, deeming it an insult to the tournament]*

*[Enter several members]*

**[Ilistus]**

Friends and comrades, hearken to my words!  

I have been wronged, cast out by those who fear  

My vision grand. Yet, we shall never falter.  

We shall arise and prove our worth and strength  

Beyond these walls where shadows cast their doubt.

**[Ilistus]**

Minos, thou art a coward, undeserved  

Of leading Witchers. Thy decision base,  

To demote me, is wrought from fear and envy.  

Thy leadership is weak, unfit to rule  

This kingdom proud, which I shall now reclaim.

**[Ilistus]**

Axion, thou art but a mere puppet,  

Dancing to Minos’s tune and false allies.  

Thou hast betrayed the spirit true of Witchers,  

Forsaking honor for a coward’s path.

*[Some members cheer, others look uncertain]*

**[Ilistus]**

We shall depart from this place, forging now  

Our destiny anew. Those who with me  

Do stand, let us depart and show our strength,  

Our resolve unmatched, beyond all measure.

*[Ilistus exits with several members, heading to the kingdom of Starglade to partake in their tournament, leaving the Witchers' tournament in disarray]*

### Act II Scene IV: Cracks in the Foundation

*[The secret council chamber echoes with a heavy silence. The council members exchange uneasy glances.]*

**[Capricio]**

A bold move indeed, Minos. His departure  

Leaves a gaping wound within our ranks so deep.  

Ilistus’s flight might lead to rash actions,  

And Witchers now must brace for coming storms.

**[Kestrelia]**

His ambition, like a viper unleashed,  

Will stir unrest among those swayed by words.  

Swiftly must we act to mend these fractures,  

Repair the rifts within this kingdom fair.

**[Axion]**

The loyalty of allies, once so firm,  

Now shall be tested by these grievous scars.  

Ilistus’s divisive leadership  

Hath left marks deeper than we first believed.  

A mission of diplomacy we must  

Embark upon, to mend these rifts before  

They widen into chasms vast and deep.

**[Minos]**

Ilistus’s treachery shall not bring  

Our Witchers to their knees! We shall rebuild,  

Stronger than we were before this dark hour.  

We will solidify our strong defenses,  

Ensuring no external threat exploits  

This moment of our internal weakness.

*[The council members nod in agreement, ready to face the challenges ahead]*

## Act III: The Shattering Bonds

### Act III Scene I: The Aftermath of Ilistus's Departure

*[The Witchers' kingdom, now weakened by the departure of Ilistus and his followers]*

**[Minos]**

Alas, the kingdom suffers from the loss  

Of those who followed Ilistus. Our strength  

Wanes, and the tournament falters now  

Without their aid to bolster our resolve.

*[Enter Capricio, Kestrelia, Axion, and Morbius]*

**[Capricio]**

Minos, thou hast done well to steer Witchers  

Through troubled waters. Yet, Ilistus’s  

Departure leaves us vulnerable indeed.  

His schemes have left a void within our ranks.

**[Kestrelia]**

Indeed, unity and wisdom are  

Our greatest allies. We must strengthen now  

Our resolve, and safeguard the kingdom firm  

From threats that lie within and from without.

**[Axion]**

Let us not forget the foundations laid  

By Morbius, who once helped build our strength.  

His counsel now is more valuable  

Than ever, as we navigate these times.

**[Morbius]**

We have weathered storms before, and we shall  

Again. Let us remain steadfast and true,  

United in our purpose and our cause.

**[Minos]**

Thy counsel is invaluable, my friends.  

We must remain vigilant and united,  

Lest Ilistus’s ambition lead us all  

To ruin and despair. Together, we  

Shall overcome the trials that lie ahead.


### Act III Scene II: Zyx's Antagonism

*[The Witchers' kingdom, in the aftermath of the failed tournament]*

**[Zyx]**

Minos, thou art not fit to lead us here.  

Thy claim unto the throne is null and void.  

Thou art not even of this kingdom’s blood!

*[Zyx holds the kingdom's assets hostage, refusing to release control to Minos]*

**[Minos]**

Zyx, thy actions sow discord and strife.  

Release the assets, let us now rebuild,  

And bring some peace unto this troubled realm.

**[Zyx]**

Nay, Minos. I shall not yield to thy rule.  

Thy leadership is weak and unworthy.  

This kingdom shall indeed suffer for it.

*[Zyx stands firm in his defiance]*

**[Minos]** *Aside*

The words of Ilistus have stirred this fire,  

And Zyx now stands against me strong.  

Together, they conspire to choke and crush  

The life and spirit of the Witchers' realm.

### Act III Scene III: Council in Tumult

*[A chamber veiled in shadows, a council gathers]*

**[Minos]** *Grim Visage*

Our kingdom teeters on a precipice dire,

From foes within, and without set afire.

My counselors wise, what counsel do you bring,

To save our Witchers from this ruinous sting?

**[Capricio]** *With a Scoff*

O Minos, fierce the storm that batters near,

And fools who chase a bauble, hold it dear.

Perhaps the crown, a burden long outgrown,

Should find a head more worthy, or else, be thrown

Into the pyre, where all our hopes may lie,

Consumed by flames that lick a darkening sky.

**[Kestrelia]** *With Measured Tones*

Though winds of change may howl with chilling might,

Through unity and wisdom, we may find light.

Exhaust all paths before despair descends,

Lest hasty actions seal our bitter ends.

**[Axion]** *Fierce Glower*

Were I in your stead, with weight upon my brow,

Years ago, the crown I would avow

Too heavy for such trials. Yet, rage burns bright,

For Zyx's treachery and Ilistus' blight!

Their wicked blades have shattered what remained

Of Witchers' guard, their power forever stained.

Perhaps from ashes, we must rise anew,

A kingdom forged where loyalty holds true.

**[Morbius]** *With Measured Strength*

Through darkness past, we've found a path to mend,

Emerging stronger, trials to transcend.

Let us not rush towards oblivion's door,

But seek the path that leads us back to shore.

**[Minos]** *With Heavy Heart*

Your words, a weight upon my troubled soul,

A choice we face, that history will extol.

The fate of Witchers hangs upon this thread,

May wisdom guide us, lest our kingdom be dead.

### Act III Scene IV: Minos' Lament

*[A chamber, richly appointed, yet heavy with solitude]*

**[Minos]** *King, pacing restlessly*

A crown of thorns, this weight upon my brow,

Leadership's burden, dragging spirit low.

Ilistus' treachery, a poisoned dart,

And Zyx's siege, that tears our realm apart.

*[Minos pauses, contemplating the vastness of the chamber]*

Within these walls, where whispers hold their sway,

The ghosts of choices past refuse to stray.

The kingdom's fate, a tapestry unfurled,

Hangs heavy, waiting for a king to wield.

*[Minos speaks with newfound resolve]*

Though shadows lengthen, and the path unclear,

A king must rise, dispel both doubt and fear.

For in this silence, where resolve is born,

I'll find the strength, or watch the kingdom mourn.

### Act III Scene V: A Council in Turmoil

**[Capricio]**

A pox upon the strife that rends our land,

Where Zyx's grip doth tighten, hearts grow sand.

The people murmur, doubt begins to creep,

And unity, our watchtower, falters deep.

**[Kestrelia]**

Minos, our king, with wisdom clear and bold,

Act with such haste as stories yet unfold.

Renew our pacts, with voices loud and strong,

Reassure all, to whom we do belong.

For unity's a shield, a wall so vast,

Against the chaos' storm, that blows aghast.

**[Axion]**

Let stalwart hearts within this council dwell,

And show the world, Witcher's purpose, tell!

With steadfast will, and purpose set alight,

We shall withstand the coming of the night.

**[Morbius]**

Seek out those hands, once clasped in warm embrace,

Rebuild the bridges, lost in time and space.

Our strength resides in numbers, hearts as one,

Lest we should falter, 'neath a rising sun.

**[Minos]**

Thy words ring true, a chorus in my ear,

On unity and strength, our future rests, I fear.

Together we shall face this coming tide,

And Witcher's spirit, o'er the storm shall ride!

### Act III Scene VI: The Precipice of Doom

*[The kingdom trembles, a reflection of Minos's fracturing mind]*

**[Zyx]**

Never shall I yield, oh Minos, your sway,

Your rule is a blight, that leads Witchers astray.

*[Discord tears the land apart, unrest like a wildfire burns]*

**[Minos]** *Aside*

Zyx's defiance, a thorn in my side,

The kingdom reels, in chaos it will confide.

No path but destruction, a terrible tide,

To punish his pride, his spirit deride.

*[Minos, consumed by sickness, wrestles with a desperate plan. The kingdom hangs in the balance, by a madman's hand.]*

## Act IV: The Final Blow and Aftermath

### Act IV Scene I: The Waning Council

*[Enter Minos, a crown of worry upon his brow, with Axion, Capricio, Kestrelia, and Morbius by his side. The council chamber, once a haven of strategy, now hangs heavy with despair.]*

**[Minos]** *with a weary sigh*

My loyal councilors, on weary shoulders I bear,

The crushing weight of Witchers' fate, a gnawing care.

Ilistus' treachery, a serpent's venomed coil,

And Zyx's rage have left our kingdom in turmoil.

**[Axion]** *eyes flashing with anger*

Aye, deep the wound they carved with vile deceit,

Ilistus' cunning plans, and Zyx's fierce retreat.

Perhaps from ashes we must rise anew,

For Witchers' grandeur, shattered, lies in view.

**[Capricio]** *a hand upon his foreign blade*

Though stranger to your realm, its woes I've known,

The seeds of discord in its heart have sown.

This burden, Minos, wears upon you sore,

Desperate times may call for measures evermore.

**[Kestrelia]** *her voice laced with sorrow*

Through ages past, in unity we thrived,

By wisdom's light our destinies derived.

Yet shadows loom, and choices must be made,

A perilous path before us, unafraid.

**[Morbius]** *grief etched upon his face*

With hands that built, I watch Witchers now decay,

Aching to mend its walls, to chase despair away.

But Axion's words, a bitter truth unfold,

A phoenix rising, may be what we hold.

*[The counselors, a chorus of despair, nod in agreement. Minos, resolve hardening in his gaze, steels himself for the choices to come.]*

### Act IV Scene II: The Confrontation with Ilistus

*[Enter Minos, with troubled brow he strides, And Ilistus before him, there confides.]*

**[Minos]**

Ilistus, hear my plea, a king distressed,

This crown, this weight, upon your head be pressed.

Your deeds, though dire, have brought us to this pass,

But leadership renewed can mend the glass.

**[Ilistus]** *With weary sigh, his voice a mournful sound*

Nay, Minos, past is power's grip I've found.

The weight of rule upon my shoulders bore,

No longer shall I claim this mantle more.

Seek other hands, where strength and hope reside,

Perhaps in Theseus, or in Balthasar's pride.

*[Ilistus turns, departs with head hung low, Leaving Minos with a bitter, burning woe.]*

**[Minos]**  *Alone he stands, his voice with anger fraught*

An insult dire! By ruin you have wrought

This kingdom bleeds, and yet you turn away?

A shattered realm you leave to face the day,

And cast aside your burden with such ease?

May gods have mercy, for I stand appeased!

### Act IV Scene III: The King's Burden

*[Enter Minos, a crown of weight upon his brow, his gaze fixed upon the vast emptiness of the throne room.]*

**[Minos]** *With a heavy sigh*

The realm doth crumble, rent by war's fell hand,

My loyal subjects, weary of the sand

That sifts through broken walls, where once they thrived.

Ilistus' might and Zyx's wrath connived

To push us to the precipice, where falls

Our very hope, unless a hero calls.

*[He paces the chamber, a storm brewing within.]*

There seems no path but one, a desperate stride,

To end this conflict, with honor as our guide.

Though victory's light seems dimmed, a distant star,

I'll fight for every inch, no matter how far.

*[Minos summons a herald, his voice firm yet laced with sorrow.]*

A message swift to Zyx, let it fly,

Inviting him to parley 'neath the sky,

Within these walls, where once we forged a bond,

Perhaps a fragile peace can yet be fond.

### Act IV Scene IV: A Kingdom Laid to Waste

*[Enter Zyx, with haste and troubled mien, He seeks the King, a storm within unseen.]*

**[Zyx]**

Minos, my liege, a summons swift you sent,

What weighs upon your mind, what dire intent?

**[Minos]** *With voice of thunder, filled with bitter scorn*

Turn, Zyx, turn, and witness what is born

From seeds of treachery, a bitter harvest sown,

Behold the kingdom's ruin, all its glories flown!

*[A gesture grand, Minos unveils the sight,
The once proud Witchers' realm, engulfed in night.
Towers crumble, walls dissolve in smoke,
A pyre of memories, a cruel, tragic joke.]*

**[Zyx]** *Aghast he cries, his voice with horror charged*

What madness grips thee, Minos? Has thy heart enlarged

With such fell rage, that thou wouldst crush the stone,

Where we, thy Witchers, built our sacred throne?

**[Minos]** *His eyes ablaze*

This is the final act, the curtain's fall,

Thy deeds, Zyx, have poisoned it all.

With Ilistus' plotting, like a serpent's sting,

You've brought our kingdom to its ruin's spring.

**[Zyx]** *With pleading tone*

But Minos, stay thy hand! Why wreak such woe?

**[Minos]** *With steely resolve*

Betrayal's poison spreads, and seeds of woe

Bear bitter fruit. Even Ilistus sees

No crown worth claiming in this wasteland vast,

A kingdom shattered, a glorious past

Erased forever. What remains to hold?

Just smoldering embers, stories yet untold.

*[Minos, with a final gesture, sweeps his hand, The library burns, knowledge turns to sand. With heavy heart, Zyx watches, despair's tide, The Witchers' kingdom, lost, nowhere to hide.]*

### Act IV Scene V: Arise from the Ashes

*[Enter Minos and Axion, amidst wreckage of the fallen kingdom]*

**[Minos]**

Where Witchers stood, proud towers now lie low,

A testament to treachery's cruel blow.

Yet from these ashes, smoldering and grim,

A new beginning, hope shall rise within!

**[Axion]**

Though shadows linger from a past betrayed,

Our spirits unbowed, a promise unafraid.

We'll carve a path where honor holds its sway,

And cast the darkness of old sins away.

*[Enter MORBIUS, Capricio, and Kestrelia, with gestures of support]*

**[Morbius]**

Though born beyond these walls, my heart finds rest

Where Witchers thrived. With thee, I'll face the test.

To mend the wounds, to rise from sorrow's hold,

And build anew, a kingdom brave and bold.

**[Capricio]**

From distant lands, our voices join as one,

Though banners differ, battles may be won

By common cause, by values held so dear.

Let's forge a future where hope banishes fear.

**[Kestrelia]**

The whispers of the past shall guide our way,

Lest lessons learned be lost along the day.

With wisdom gleaned from trials overcome,

A kingdom strong, where unity shall bloom.

**[Minos]**

With such resolve, a dawn shall pierce the night!

From Witchers' ashes, strength shall take its flight.

Arise, brave hearts, and let us build anew,

A realm where justice reigns, forever true.

**[Axion]**

The weight of Ilithus' deeds, a heavy chain,

No longer binds us in its dark domain.

We step forth free, with spirits light and bold,

To claim a future yet to be unrolled.

**[Minos]**

A burden lifted, though the scars remain,

A king's sorrow etched in heart and brain.

Though Witchers fell, the price, I freely paid,

For freedom's light from darkness' hold is made.

*[They stand united, a beacon in the gloom, as the curtain falls in silence]*

## Act V: The Aftermath and New Beginnings

### Act V Scene I: Minos's Reflection

*[Enter Minos, cloaked in shadow, and Axion, his steps echoing through the shattered remnants of the fallen kingdom]*

**[Minos]** *Gazing upon the wreckage with a weary sigh*

Behold, fair Axion, where Witchers' grandeur stood,

A monument to folly, etched in broken stone.

The weight of kingship, heavy as a shroud,

Did press upon my brow, and I, alone,

Did bear the burdens of a tainted brood.

**[Axion]** *Placing a hand on Minos's shoulder*

Despair not, King. Though ruins mark the ground,

And whispers of past failures fill the air,

You played your part with honor, purpose found.

The scars we see were etched long ere you came to care.

**[Minos]** *Turning to Axion, a flicker of resolve in his eyes*

You speak the truth, my friend. Though grief may sting,

For what is lost, a solace can we claim.

The chains that bound us to a tainted king,

Are shattered, and a brighter dawn we'll name.

**[Axion]** *A determined glint mirroring Minos's gaze*

Then let us rise from ashes, hearts aflame,

And build anew on ruins, free from blame.

### Act V Scene II: Rekindling the Flame

*[Enter Minos, Axion, Capricio, Kestrelia, Morbius, and sundry others, conversing in hushed tones.]*

**[Morbius]**

Though Witchers' realm lies shattered, friends, its soul

Within our hearts still burns, a glowing coal.

From ruin's grasp, a stronger path we'll forge,

Rebuild anew, a kingdom yet more large.

**[Capricio]**

Ilistus, villain with a serpent's tongue,

With treachery's web, this kingdom he unstrung.

But from the ashes, wisdom shall arise,

And phoenix-like, stronger we shall rise!

Though Witchers' name be naught but memory's trace,

Know, Minos, you have champions in this place.

**[Kestrelia]**

By wisdom's light and unity's embrace,

We'll mend the wounds etched on this weary face.

Witchers' demise, a lesson hard and stark,

On trust and honor, we shall build our ark.

Though kingdoms separate, our purpose one,

Your cause is just, your victory begun.

*[Enter Phazymus and Psycharus, somber expressions upon their faces.]*

**[Phazymus]**

A noble fall, a dream that turned to dust,

Learn from its ashes, rise with greater gust.

This is no time for empty praise, nor sighs,

But for reflection in clear, discerning eyes.

**[Psycharus]**

Let healing touch the wounds that fester sore,

From Witchers' ashes, build forevermore.

**[Capricio]**

The past a prologue, let us turn the page,

The future beckons, etched on history's stage.

United hearts shall conquer any foe,

Our kingdoms stand with you, where'er you go.

**[Kestrelia]**

The weight of crowns, a burden few can bear,

Decisions wrought with doubt, with ceaseless care.

Minos, with noble heart, for Witchers strove,

And now, as allies, we offer all our love.

**[Minos]**

With loyal friends like these, my spirit thrives,

A dawning hope, a kingdom that survives.

Gather our allies, let the trumpets sound,

A glorious new era on hallowed ground!

### Act V Scene III: 'Midst Crumbled Stone and Fallen Grace

*[Enter Ilistus, Zyx, and Followers, their faces grim]*

**[Ilistus]** *Gazing upon the wreckage*

Behold the remnants, where our kingdom stood,

A glorious Watchtower, now a field of blood!

These traitors' blades have wrought this woeful sight,

Their treachery shall bathe in endless night!

**[Zyx]** *Voice deep with sorrow*

Thy words ring true, Ilistus. Minos' sin,

A serpent's hiss where loyalty had been.

He hath unraveled Witchers, thread by thread,

His reign of terror, o'er our home now spread.

**[Ilistus]** *Wrathful and bitter*

They'll drown in guilt, a sea of memories,

Of shattered trust and burning destinies!

Their every breath a torment, sharp and keen,

A constant echo of what once had been!

*[Enter Capricio, stepping forth with purpose]*

**[Capricio]** *Pointing a finger at Ilistus*

Hold, Ilistus! Thy thirst for vengeance blinds,

Thy schemes, the seeds of ruin intertwines!

This desolation, 'tis thy doing all,

Thy plots and machinations caused our fall!

**[Ilistus]** *Scowling darkly*

A blatant lie!  Thou art the serpent's tongue,

Whose poisoned words our harmony unstrung!

Thy meddling counsel, whispers in the dark,

Led to this chaos, left its savage mark!

*[Enter Phazymus, his voice measured and firm]*

**[Phazymus]** *Placing a hand on Ilistus' shoulder*

Peace, brother! Let not rage cloud reason's light.

Minos, the tyrant, wields the hand of blight.

His actions wrought this havoc, dire and stark,

Not Capricio's whispers in the fading dark.

**[Ilistus]** *Voice rising again*

Witchers are shattered, legacy defiled!

By treachery's hand, our kingdom exiled!

This burden rests upon your traitorous heads,

A twisted crown of thorns, where loyalty treads!

*[The Followers stir, voices hushed in debate, unsure of where the truth may lie, their faces etched with worry]*

### Act V Scene IV: A Court in Turmoil

*[Enter Minos, a crown askew, with Axion, Capricio, Kestrelia, Morbius, Phazymus, Psycharus, and a throng of followers]*

**[Zyx]** *stepping forth, voice ringing with accusation*

Minos, thou standest here, a king of shattered dreams,

The legacy of Witchers, crushed beneath thy schemes!

Their history, their home, all lie in smoldering ash,

And on thy bloodied hands, their fate, a heavy lash!

**[Minos]** *defensive, yet weary*

Hold, Zyx! Hear me now, ere judgement swiftly falls,

The kingdom, long before, within its walls did crawl

With whispers of dissent, of treachery's foul stain,

I sought to mend the cracks, this realm from ruin gain!

**[Dartos]** *voice thick with anger*

A noble aim, perhaps, yet steeped in crimson tide,

Thou'st razed our very past, where Witchers once did confide!

How can we trust thy hand to guide us through the night,

When all we see are ruins bathed in pale moonlight?

**[Morbius]** *stepping forward, voice measured*

Hold back, Dartos, wrath consumes but clouds the mind,

Let us not turn on one another, for treachery we'll find

Lurks still in shadows deep. We must from this arise,

Learn from the ashes fallen, beneath accusing skies.

**[Capricio]** *nodding gravely*

Aye, Morbius speaks with wisdom, for a leader's weight

Bears heavy burdens down, decisions fraught with fate.

Not every choice a crown compels is clear and bright,

Let understanding bloom, where shadows dimmed the light.

**[Kestrelia]** *eyes bright with hope*

Leave we the Witchers' remnants, their sorrow and their pain,

A new dawn beckons forth, a future we can claim!

United, hand in hand, a brighter path we'll pave,

With lessons learned from ashes, a kingdom strong and brave!

### Act V Scene V: Hope's Dawn and Resolve's Call

*[Enter Minos, Axion, Morbius, Capricio, Kestrelia, Phazymus, Psycharus, and loyal kin]*

**[Minos]** *With weary grace*

A weary road we've trod, with burdens sore,

The Witchers' weight upon our hearts no more.

Ilistus' deeds, a chapter turned and sealed,

Relief descends, a wound at last revealed.

**[Axion]** *Voice firm*

A dawn breaks forth, a chapter yet unwritten,

With strength and wisdom, kingdoms shall be smitten

By justice' fair hand, a realm of righteous might

Where time itself shall sing of virtue's light.

**[Morbius]** *Eyes alight*

Let honor bind us to the Witchers' past,

Where unity, like seeds, in hearts were cast.

A future blooms with promise, vast and grand,

A testament to what united hands can command.

**[Capricio]** *Hand on sword*

No foe shall stand where fellowship holds sway,

Our loyal hearts, a fortress come what may.

In bonds of friendship, forged in fiery strife,

We face the unknown, a valiant, vibrant life.

**[Kestrelia]** *Hopeful gaze*

The bygone fades, a tale for minstrels' tongue,

The future beckons, a song yet to be sung.

With hearts ablaze, let purpose be our guide,

United steps, in hope's swift current ride.

**[Minos]** *Voice rings strong*

Your faith, dear friends, a beacon in the night,

Together, we shall conquer every blight.

Onward we march, to forge a land anew,

Where peace shall reign, and prosperity accrue.

**[Kestrelia]** *Voice soaring*

With every stride, our bond, a chain so bright,

A memory etched in dawn's ethereal light.

The Witchers' legacy, a compass ever true,

In unity we rise, a people strong and new.
